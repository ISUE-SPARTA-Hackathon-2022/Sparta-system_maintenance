## SPARTA Hacktahon - Inadequate farm machineries, equipment and post-harvest facilities to increase yield.

### Details of the Category
Blessed with agricultural wealth and hardworking people, Cauayan City aspires to mechanize agricultural activities with interventions of appropriate equipment and post-harvest facilities necessary to achieve sustainable yield. The Development Academy of the Philippines in collaboration with the City of Cauayan invites all Data Analytics Experts, Agricultural Engineers, Extensionists, and other stakeholders to participate in this Hackathon in modifying digital solutions to address the inadequacy of farm machinery and produce designs with minimal budgetary requirement and maximum capacity to increase yield. Data sets contributed to the challenge will be housed in the Smart Governance Portal of SPARTA and remarkable innovations specifically designed will be given othe opportunity for pitching.

The following use-case statements are your guide to help you align your intention in addressing areas of this challenge:

1. How can D&T aid in developing cost-effective blueprints for regional organizations in addressing yield expansion?
2. How can DSA help the LGU identify the appropriate agri-machinery necessary to address excessive yield loss and organize farmers to expose themselves to such innovation?
3. How can DSA help narrow the gap between the government and farmers in the adoption of new agricultural innovations?
4. How can D&T support business groups and NGOs in alleviating farmers with inadequate resources?
5. How can DSA be utilized in developing smarter farming techniques and establishing post-harvest facilities to increase yield and attract investors to sustain the needs of the sector in LGU?
6. How can DSA emphasize the significance of smarter farm machinery and post-harvest facilities to convene business opportunities for Civil Societies to support local capabilities?
7. How can D&T assist in monitoring the effects of climate change on the seasonal yield of farmers?
8. How can DSA help the LGU prevent more agricultural losses when calamities hit communities and other vulnerable areas?
9. How can data be utilized to develop digital infrastructures that will notify the LGU of any threats and agricultural significance that may arise along the way?
10. How can D&T provide figures for effective farming techniques using sustainable equipment and facilities?
11. How can DSA be a way to develop smarter sustainable solutions and post-harvest facilities to help achieve long-term impacts?
12. How can DSA assist the LGU in developing more sustainable farm machinery and post-harvest facilities that are accessible for farmers and will not displace them from the farmlands with such development?"
13. How can D&T adapt statistics in measuring food production?
14. How can DSA help the LGU resolve inaccessibility to innovative farm machinery and facilities and pursue digital solutions to agricultural self-sufficiency?
15. How can DSA assist LGU in the development of agricultural machinery and other significant infrastructure targeting food insecurity?
16. How can D&T educate farmers in using different techniques to increase its harvest and yield?
17. How can LGU encourage the youth and other local experts to utilize existing data sets and develop innovations to house job opportunities in the agricultural sector?
18. How can DSA be marketed as an opportunity to design/invent digital infrastructures for agriculture?"
